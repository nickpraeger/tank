Pebble watchface inspired by Cartier Tank watch

This watchface was bodged together out of bits of code from the pebble examples and seems to just about work the way I wanted it to.
At some point I might redo the background so the second hand perfectly lines up with it but for now it is finished.
Also I don't seem to be able to get it to publish properly on the pebble app store, hence I'm supplyig the code here.
